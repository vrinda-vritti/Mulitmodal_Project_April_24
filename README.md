Sentiment analysis, a pivotal component of natural language processing (NLP), plays a crucial 
role in deciphering the underlying emotions, opinions, and attitudes expressed within textual 
data. Traditional sentiment analysis models predominantly rely on textual inputs, limiting their 
ability to capture the nuanced complexities of human expression across different modalities. 
However, in today's multimedia-rich environment, where textual, visual, and auditory 
information coalesce to form a multifaceted narrative, there arises a pressing need for sentiment 
analysis systems capable of effectively processing and integrating information from diverse 
modalities.
The advent of multimodal sentiment analysis, which harnesses the collective power of text, 
images, and audio inputs, presents a compelling opportunity to enhance the granularity and 
accuracy of sentiment analysis outcomes. At the heart of this paradigm shift lies attention 
fusion, a sophisticated fusion technique that combines attention mechanisms with multimodal 
fusion strategies to distil insights from disparate modalities and synthesize a more 
comprehensive understanding of sentiment.
This project embarks on a journey to explore the realm of multimodal sentiment analysis, with 
a specific focus on the integration of attention fusion methodologies. The objective is twofold: 
firstly, to develop a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis model capable of processing multimodal 
inputs encompassing text, images, and audio; and secondly, to leverage attention fusion 
techniques to intelligently combine information from diverse modalities, thereby enriching the 
sentiment analysis process and yielding more nuanced and accurate sentiment predictions.
